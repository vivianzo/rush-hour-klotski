# Maze-generation
This project was developed as part of Northeastern's Fundamentals of Computer Science II class during the Spring of 2024

# Logistics
The goal of this assignment was to create a that is an abstract version of [Rush Hour](https://www.thinkfun.com/rush-hour-online-play/) and [Klotski](https://josephpetitti.com/klotski). Both games have different components but are comprised of similar features and we were able to make a combined version of both games with some additional features. Here are some of the implemented features: 
* Players can see their score
* Players can undo moves they made (undoing increases the score)
* Players can create their string representation of a board and parse it
* Players can make obstacles in their boards
